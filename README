First GrapesJS Project

These are a few test pages I was using to work with the GrapesJS Framework which is a framework to help you build 
a webpage editor.

Each page links to a css and or js file with the same name.

To run clone the repository to your system.
In your terminal:
Enter the first-grapesjs-project directory.
Run "npm install"
Run "node server.js"
Server is at localhost:8080
Then pick a path from the server.js file for instance "http://localhost:8080/page-3" etc.
